## Organization

Each FCC lesson I'd like to keep the solution for should have its own JS file with the matching name. I intend to keep track of which lessons are included in each CC video below for ease of reference. 

 - [Javscript Fundamentals #4](https://youtu.be/wvpxFYVe81k)
	 - [Record Collection](/basic_javascript/record_collection.js)
 - [Javascript/ES6 #1](https://youtu.be/2ASg0kjG2xY)
     - [Iterate with Javascript While Loops](/basic_javascript/iterate_with_javascript_while_loops.js)
     - [Iterate with Javascript For Loops](/basic_javascript/iterate_with_javascript_for_loops.js)
     - [Iterate Odd Numbers with a For Loop](/basic_javascript/iterate_odd_numbers_with_a_for_loop.js)
