## Welcome to my FreeCodeCamp learning repo! :chick

I'm using this repo to keep track of my solutions and notes across devices. 

At the moment, I'm working through the [Javascript Algorithms & Data Structures course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures) through the lectures made available on [Class Central](https://www.youtube.com/c/ClassCentral).
